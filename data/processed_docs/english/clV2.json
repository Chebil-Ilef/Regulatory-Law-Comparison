The New York \nNo-Fault Law provides for the payment of benefits to victims of motor vehicle accidents to reimburse them for their basic \neconomic loss. Briefly summarized, basic economic loss consists of up to $50,000 per person in benefits for the following: \na. \nall necessary doctor and hospital bills and other health service expenses, payable in accordance with fee \nschedules established or adopted by the New York State Department of Financial Services; \nb. \n80% of lost earnings up to a maximum monthly payment of $2,000 for up to three years following the date of the \naccident; \nc. \nup to $25 per day for a period of one year from the date of the accident for other reasonable and necessary \nexpenses the injured person may have incurred because of an injury resulting from the accident, such as the cost \nof hiring a housekeeper or necessary transportation expenses to and from a health service provider; and \nd. \na $2,000 death benefit, payable to the estate of a covered person, in addition to the $50,000 coverage for \neconomic loss described above. \nAdditional benefits may be owed to you if the above policy has been endorsed to include Optional Basic Economic Loss \ncoverage and/or Additional Personal Injury Protection coverage. \nIn determining the benefits payable to you under the No-Fault Law, amounts recovered or recoverable on account of the \naccident from Workers' Compensation, New York State Disability, and certain wage continuation plans will reduce your No-\nFault benefits. Therefore, if you are entitled to any of these benefits you should make your claim for them promptly. \nIf you are a named insured or relative under a Mandatory Personal Injury Protection policy which includes OBEL coverage, \nyou may be entitled to an additional $25,000 of Basic Economic Loss coverage. You should make your claim to that motor \nvehicle insurer promptly, but in no event later than 90 days after your $50,000 of Basic Economic Loss coverage under this \npolicy is exhausted. \nNOTE: The No-Fault Law provides that if you are injured on a bus or a school bus in New York State, No-Fault benefits must \nbe paid by your auto insurer or if you have no auto, the auto insurer of a relative with whom you reside. The law further \nprovides that you should only file a No-Fault claim with the insurer of the bus or school bus if there is no such auto policy in \nyour household. The above rule does not apply and you may file a No-Fault claim with the insurer of the bus or school bus if \nyou are the operator, owner or employee of the owner of the bus company.\nNYS FORM NF-1B (Rev 6/2013) \nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOVER LETTER -- PAGE TWO \nTo enable us to determine if you are entitled to any No-Fault benefits, please complete and immediately return the enclosed \nAPPLICATION FOR MOTOR VEHICLE NO-FAULT BENEFITS (NYS FORM NF-2) along with copies of any bills you have \nreceived to date.
