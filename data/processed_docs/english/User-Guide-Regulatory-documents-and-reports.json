Glossary \n1.1. \nGlossary \nNotion \nDefinition \nBucket \nA bucket is a container for objects. S3 stores data as objects \nwithin buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes \nthe file. Each entity manages its own separate buckets to be used \nfor each report type. \nIFMs \nInvestment Fund Managers \nIT Expert \nThe “IT Expert” is an eDesk specific role that is granted by the \n\"Advanced User\" of the entity to the person managing access to \nthe S3 API. A person with this role is responsible for creating, \nviewing and revoking access keys.  \nS3 \nS3 – or “simple storage service” – is the object storage protocol \n(through a web service interface) used by the CSSF for the file \nexchange. In this context, S3 simply refers to the protocol for \nmanaging object storage and does not rely on any services \nprovided by commercial cloud providers. \nRegulatory \ndocuments and \nreports \nThis term refer to two types of document: Articles of incorporation \n(AI) and Management Regulations (MR) \n2. Introduction \nThe general objective of this document is to provide practical and technical information on the \nRegulatory documents and reports (AI/MR) submission to CSSF. \nAll the entities concerned by AI/MR submission must provide a document to CSSF when they \nestablish or update them. It is strongly recommended that all entities send us the latest version of \nthe Management Regulations or the latest consolidated version of the Articles of incorporation. This \nwill help to create a reliable statistical database on which to carry out consistent analyses. \nThe entities subject to the External Asset Managers reporting can submit it through two channels: \nvia online form filling (eDesk procedure) or by S3 submission.  \nThe AI/MR received are then sent for publication to Fundsquare. \n3. Scope \nThe AI/MRs must be submitted by the fund (self managed) or IFM (management company for UCITS \nor AIFM for AIFs externally managed). This means that the enrolment process  must be done by the \nentity responsible for the submission of the data. \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n5/18 \n4. eDesk application \n4.1. \nAuthentication and connection \nThe person in charge of submitting the document is required to have an eDesk account (available \nwith a LuxTrust authentication) and must be linked to the relevant entity. Further details can be \nfound in the User Guide (“Authentication and user account management”) from the dedicated section \nof \nthe \nCSSF \neDesk \nPortal \nhomepage: \nhttps://edesk.apps.cssf.lu/edesk-\ndashboard/dashboard/getstarted. \n4.2. \neDesk dashboard homepage \n \nThe eDesk homepage screen is split as follows: \n• The Header is the upper part of the screen where you can find: \nO \nThe navigation menu that shows several useful links. “CSSF.lu” sends you back to the \nCSSF website. “About the CSSF” and “Privacy policy” send you to the dedicated CSSF \nwebsite sections respectively about CSSF itself and its privacy policy. \nO \nThe language option is available on each screen and it is possible to switch between \nlanguages throughout the authentication procedure. \nO \nThe “Log in” button takes you to the screen to be used to connect to the eDesk portal. \nO \nThe “Procedures” button that takes you to the “Log in” page if you are not connected yet \nor the procedures list. \n• The Toolbox gathers several e-services (applications) that do not require an authentication. \n• The News section presents the latest information related to eDesk. \n• The Footer at the bottom of the screen is non-interactive. \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n6/18 \n4.3. \nAccess to procedures \nClick on the ‘Access to procedures’ button and search for the AI/MR deposit operation using the \n‘Investment funds and vehicles / Investment fund managers’ filter. \n \nTo submit the AI/MR, click on the hyperlink “Regulatory Documents and Reports”. \n4.4. \nAI/MR submission \n4.4.1. \nProcedure dashboard \nWhen accessing the procedure, a top banner contains several links and useful information: \n• \na link to the global eDesk Dashboard (by clicking on the “eDesk” logo). \n• \na link to the CSSF website (“Site cssf.lu”). \n• \na drop-down list of languages available in the app. \n• \na drop-down menu for the user profile and the logout button. \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n7/18 \n \nThe main part of the page has two sections, one relating to AI an another relating to MR. Each of \nthe two sections has two links: One, enabling you to submit and view AI/MR corresponding to the \nentity for which you are responsible, and another to manage delegations and grant authorization to \nan external entity to submit AI/MR \n \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n8/18 \n4.4.1.1. \nSubmission of  Articles of incorporation/ Management \nregulations (AI/MRs) \nIn the following, we will only describe the AI filling procedure. The procedure of filling AI is identical \nto that for MR.  \nTo make it easier to process your AI/MR, it is strongly advised to use the following nomenclature for \nall your AI/MR:  \n• \nDOCREP-ENNNNNNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-AI-LL for AI \n• \nDOCREP-ENNNNNNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-MR-LL for MR \nTo start the submission process, click on the “Submission and follow-up of articles of incorporation \n(AI)” link. \n \n \n• \nSubmission and follow-up of articles of incorporation (AI) \nThe list of all submitted AI is displayed. To submit an AI, click on the “Upload a new AI” button.  \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n9/18 \n• \nUpload new AI \n \nThis view allows the user to upload the document in pdf format. Click on the “Browse your files” \nbutton to access your local directory and select the document to upload. Once the document has \nbeen added, click on the “Transmit” button to submit the uploaded document. \nA confirmation pop-up is displayed. When the Send button is clicked again, the submission \nconfirmation message is displayed. \n \n• \nConfirmation of AI sending \nThis screen shows that your document has been submitted to the CSSF \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n10/18 \n4.4.1.2. \nFollow up of articles of incorporation (AI) or management \nregulations (MRs) submitted \nThe link “Submission and follow-up of articles of incorporation (AI)/ “Submission and follow-up of \nmanagement regulations (MR) allows you to view all the AI/MR filed for the entity. AI/MR are \ndisplayed from the most recent to the oldest date. This space allows you to consult the AI/MR you \nhave transferred, as well as all the AI/MR transmitted by the various other people in your entity. \n \n4.4.1.3. \nManagement of delegations for AI/MRs  \nThe “Management of delegations for AI” and “Management of delegations for MRs” links allow a \ndelegator (user of an entity) to give the possibility to a delegate (user of a third entity) to use eDesk \nto file an AI/MRs on his behalf. \nTo carry out this delegation, the delegator clicks on the “Management of delegations for AI/MRs” \nlink. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n11/18 \nThe following screen appears: \n \nClick on the “Create a new delegation” button, a pop-up window appears: \n \n \n• \nEnter the e-mail address of the delegate (natural person) who will be responsible for filing \nAI documents on behalf of the delegator's entity. \n• \nAdd a communication (optional) \n• \nSelect the funds under management for which you wish to grant a delegation \n• \nAt the end, click on the Submit button \n \nThe delegate receives an e-mail with the subject line : “Invitation to contribute on CSSF eDesk \nRegulatory documents and reports for funds” \n \n \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n12/18 \n \nThe body of the email is as follows: \n \n \n \nTo accept the delegation and submit the documents on behalf of the delegator, the delegate must \nclick on the link contained in the e-mail. The delegate will be asked to log in to his edesk account \nusing his credentials. \n \n \nOnce connected, the following screen is displayed and the delegate can submit AI/MR to the CSSF \non behalf of the delegator entity by following the submission process \n \n\n \nREGULATORY DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS \nVersion of 19/11/2024 (EN) \nVersion 1.1 (EN) \n13/18 \n5.
